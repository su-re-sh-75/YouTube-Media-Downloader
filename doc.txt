Paginating the Search Results:

1) The search results are paginated using Django's Paginator class. 
This class takes the list of search results (video_list) 
and the number of results to display per page (per_page in our example, set to 10).
The Paginator instance is created with paginator = Paginator(video_list, per_page).
Next, the current page number is obtained from the request's GET parameters using page_number = request.GET.get('page').
The get_page() method of the Paginator object is used to get a Page object for the current page. 
This handles invalid page numbers and returns an empty page instead.
The page_obj variable holds the Page object representing the current page of search results.

Passing Pagination Links in the Template:

2) In the template (search_results.html), the pagination links are included to navigate between pages of search results.
The links are generated using the page_obj object and 
its attributes has_previous, has_next, previous_page_number, and next_page_number.
To preserve the search query parameter (search) when navigating between pages, 
the pagination_query_params variable is passed to the template context. 
This variable is generated in the search view.
In the pagination links, the pagination_query_params is appended to the query string using {{ pagination_query_params }}.

Handling Pagination Links in the View:

3) When a pagination link is clicked, the request is sent to the search view with the updated page number in the GET parameters.
The search view retrieves the updated page number from the request's GET parameters (page_number = request.GET.get('page')).
The get_page() method is called again with the updated page number to get the corresponding Page object.
The page_obj variable is updated with the new Page object, and it is included in the context for rendering in the template.
By implementing pagination, the search results are split into smaller subsets and displayed on separate pages. 
This approach improves performance by reducing the amount of data rendered and loaded in the browser at once. 
Users can navigate through the search results by clicking on the "Previous" and "Next" pagination links.

    paginator = Paginator(video_list, per_page=10)
    page_number = request.GET.get('page')
    page_obj = paginator.get_page(page_number)
    context = {'page_obj': page_obj}


    # Include the search query in the pagination links
query_params = request.GET.copy()
    if 'page' in query_params:
        del query_params['page']
    pagination_query_params = query_params.urlencode()

    context['pagination_query_params'] = pagination_query_params


1) query_params is a copy of the GET parameters in the request. 
The copy() method is used to create a mutable copy of the request.GET QueryDict object.

2) The next section of code checks if the 'page' parameter exists in the query_params dictionary. 
If it does, it is removed using the del statement. 
This is done because the 'page' parameter will be dynamically updated in the pagination links, 
so it should not be included as part of the query parameters for the other links.

3) After removing the 'page' parameter, the urlencode() method is called on the query_params object. 
This method converts the dictionary into a URL-encoded string representation. 
It properly escapes special characters and formats the query parameters in the standard URL format (key1=value1&key2=value2&...).

4) Finally, the resulting URL-encoded query parameters string (pagination_query_params) is stored in the context dictionary with the key 'pagination_query_params'. 
This makes it available to be passed to the template and used in the pagination links.

4) By including the pagination_query_params in the pagination links, 
it ensures that the other query parameters (excluding the 'page' parameter) are preserved when navigating between pages. 
It prevents the loss of any existing query parameters during pagination.

5) Overall, this code snippet handles the preservation of query parameters other than 'page' in the pagination links, 
ensuring that the complete state of the search query is maintained when navigating between pages.

from django.utils import timezone
from datetime import timedelta

# Get the current date and time
current_date = timezone.now().date()

# Calculate the date of yesterday
yesterday = current_date - timedelta(days=1)

# Delete history objects with down_time from yesterday
History.objects.filter(down_time__day=yesterday.day, down_time__lt=current_date).delete()

# Query today's history objects
history_today = History.objects.filter(down_time__gte=current_date)

# Print today's history objects
for obj in history_today:
    print(obj)

In this example, we first calculate the current date and then determine the date of yesterday by subtracting one day. 
We use the filter method with down_time__day to match the day of yesterday and down_time__lt to match any time before today. 
This filters the history objects with a down_time from yesterday. We then delete those objects using the delete method.
Finally, we query the history objects with down_time from today using down_time__gte (greater than or equal to the current date).
